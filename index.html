<h1>How to Survive unturned:</h1>
<p>step one.</p>
    <p2>
    Find a vehicle ,gas can and a place with gas in it.</p2>
    <p>
    step 2.
</p>
    
    <p2>
    If in a server with other people in it I recommend to build a base in a area that you find secure that you believe other people dont come by that much or dont come by at all, before you start building you must find an axe or a chainsaw to make a wooden base but if you want to make a metal base in the russia map you should go to the mine located east to get a pickaxe and mine the rocks. but you need to find an area that is hidden and is secure ,once you have found that area you have to go into your crafting system by clicking Y (the default button) once your in there to create a wooden floor you need to search up floor in the search bar then click on the floor you want a triangular one or a sqaure floor once you have placed that down you need to make 4 pillars to put walls down and after that you can put wooden window frames down if you want but you would need metal to make glass or make shudders after you have done that you need to put a doorframe down where you can access it and then put a metal door if you you dont want other players coming in or place a wooden door if you want to run the risk of other players coming in and taking all your items but if you dont want to run the risk and you want a wooden door then you could make a claim flag.</p2>
    <h2>
    step 3.</h2>
    <p3> 
    after making a base you should get 2 metal sheets from 4 metal scraps to make 2 metal sheets to craft a saw to craft planks and planks to sticks to make crates to store your items but if the crates can be accessed by anyone but if you want just you and your group to access the loot make a locker which costs alot of 8 metal scraps, enough exp to upgrade your crafting levels to level III (3)  you will also need a blowtorch to make 3 metal bars or if you dont find a blowtorch you could find metal bars around any map if you dont know where you are and you dont know where to go or if you have just lost your way and you do that alot try to go to the east (the way that the sun rises) then turn right until you find a little tunnel stop there and try and find a gps or a chart and once you have found that you can craft a locker that can safely store the items that you want to keep to yourself and your group members but if you are playing on a server where people can blow up your base they could also blow up your lockers but you could blow the other players lockers.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
<p>
    Step 4.</p>
    <p4>
    Finally you can add your extra features to your base like adding a place to relax with beach chairs or making your base feel like home by adding a kitchen, adding windows with glass in them, adding a place to eat like a living room, adding a bedroom, adding a shop , adding a restaurant, adding a storage place or adding a generator room ( explained in the next step)

    <p>
        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Step 5.</p>
        <p6>
        Generators: Generators are ideal for an amazing base they can run spotlights, lamps, cagelights, they can even run soda machines if the machines are in the radius of the energy being emitted from the generator industrial generators give a bigger radius than small portable generators that you could put on vehicles. The generators can also make the lights work in places that have lights hanging from the roof or they can make the streetlights work. These generators run on gas so if you are getting off the computer or going away from your base then you should turn the generator/generators off to save the gas being used up and if you are in multiplayer I recommend you use it when you really need it because the admins might only reset the server every month.

    Other stuff to do but surviving:</p>
    <p7>
        There are a few little things you can do in unturned when you dont feel like playing servers or the servers are not at your update, one thing you could do is open up cases  which cost money (the keys cost $0.99 USD and the cases vary in prices), secondly you could create your own map by going to workshop and manually dropping items into the map to create a good map you must include shops, military bases, signs, hiding places and many other things if you want to go crazy you can go mad with creating the map.
